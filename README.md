# Releasy

A unified release management platform for complex CI/CD environments.

## The Problem

Working with multiple CI/CD platforms is painful. Budget constraints, compliance requirements, and legacy systems force teams to use Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Airflow, and other tools simultaneously.

This creates real problems:

- Operators spend time managing permissions across different platforms
- Developers waste time learning each tool and switching contexts
- Everyone deals with complex interfaces full of features they don't need
- Thousands of daily deployments become a management nightmare

## The Solution

Releasy aims to provide a single, simple interface for managing releases across multiple CI/CD platforms. The goal is to hide platform complexity while keeping essential functionality accessible.

### **Current Status: Planning Phase**

This project is in early planning stages. No code has been written yet.

## Development Approach

### **Frontend-First Strategy**

Since the core goal is improving UI/UX for developers and operators, I'm starting with frontend demos to validate the user experience before building backend systems.

### **Current Focus: UI/UX Demo**

- Designing intuitive interfaces for common CI/CD operations
- Prototyping permission request/approval workflows
- Testing usability assumptions with interactive mockups

_Why frontend first?_ I've already implemented similar backend systems (multi-Jenkins integration, permission workflows) in production environments. The real challenge is creating a user interface that actually simplifies complex operations.

## Planned Features

- Multi-platform CI/CD management (starting with Jenkins)
- Integrated permission request/approval workflows
- Simplified interface focused on common use cases
- Audit trail for compliance requirements

## Roadmap

1. **Frontend Demo** - Interactive UI prototypes and user flow validation
2. **Jenkins Integration** - Connect demo to real Jenkins instances
3. **Permission System** - Build approval workflows with audit logging
4. **Additional Platforms** - Expand to GitHub Actions, Airflow, etc.
